I know this sounds clich\u00e9 and all, but truly, this is a moment in life that I\u2019ll never forget.  \n\nCastleminer Z was an important part of my childhood. For me, life wasn\u2019t as easy for me as usual. I\u2019d get bullied alot, and I was pretty socially awkward. However, the games you make have made me emotional alot better.\nI was a person who somewhat missed out on the popular games like Call of Duty, GTA, and more games that would take forever to mention. I\u2019m was a kid who\u2019d accidentally get the more obscure games. Castleminer Z was probably the first indie game I ever played. When I first got Castleminer Z, I was pretty scared of the game. Zombies, guns, and violence, I wasn\u2019t ready to play the game. But then, as a tried playing it, I soon began to love it. \nCastleminer Z was one of the few games where I\u2019d actually make friends with people, and honestly made me feel relaxed and relieved. Yeah, I was still socially awkward, but I just try to be patient with people. And honestly, I felt like a get to laugh, smile, and feel happy more in real life after playing that game. \nIt was great therapy to me, and I just can\u2019t thank you enough for your work. \n\n       - Ducktober M.",
